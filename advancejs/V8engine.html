<!-- The V8 engine serves as the core JavaScript engine, providing the fundamental capabilities for executing JavaScript code. However, when integrated into different runtime environments, additional APIs and functionalities are provided to extend the capabilities of JavaScript beyond the language itself.The V8 engine is primarily written in C++. It is a high-performance, open-source JavaScript and WebAssembly engine developed by the Chromium project, which is the open-source project behind the Google Chrome browser. The V8 engine is known for its speed and efficiency in executing JavaScript code, and it is designed to be embedded in various applications, not just web browsers.

Here are two examples:

Google Chrome Browser:

In the context of the Google Chrome web browser, the V8 engine is embedded to execute JavaScript code within web pages. Chrome provides additional APIs, collectively known as the Web Platform APIs, that allow JavaScript code to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, make HTTP requests, work with graphics, and more.
These APIs enable developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages by manipulating the content and structure of the HTML document, handling user interactions, and making network requests.

Node.js:

In the context of Node.js, V8 is used as the JavaScript runtime for server-side development. Node.js extends the JavaScript environment by providing a set of built-in modules that allow server-side JavaScript code to perform tasks such as file system operations, networking, and asynchronous I/O.
Node.js also introduces the concept of the Event Loop, enabling non-blocking, asynchronous execution, which is crucial for handling concurrent connections in server applications. -->
