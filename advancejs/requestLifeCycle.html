<!-- The request life cycle refers to the sequence of events that occur when a client sends an HTTP request to a server and the server processes that request, ultimately responding back to the client. The life cycle involves several stages, each with specific tasks and events. Here is a simplified overview of the request life cycle:

Client-Side: Initiating the Request:

Event Trigger (Client-Side): The request life cycle begins when a user interacts with a web page, leading to the initiation of an HTTP request.
HTTP Request Generation (Client-Side): The client-side application (typically a web browser) generates an HTTP request based on the user's action, such as clicking a link, submitting a form, or making an asynchronous request (e.g., with AJAX).

Client-Side: Sending the Request:

Sending the Request (Client-Side): The generated HTTP request is sent to the server. This can be done using the browser's built-in capabilities or through client-side JavaScript code.

Server-Side: Receiving and Processing the Request:

Server Receives the Request (Server-Side): The server receives the incoming HTTP request.
Routing and Middleware (Server-Side): The server's routing mechanism determines which part of the server's code (usually represented by routes and middleware) should handle the request.

Server-Side: Application Logic and Business Processing:

Application Logic (Server-Side): The server executes the application logic associated with the received request. This may involve database queries, authentication, authorization, and other business-specific operations.
Server-Side: Generating the Response:

Response Generation (Server-Side): The server generates an HTTP response that includes a response status, headers, and an optional response body.

Server-Side: Sending the Response:

Sending the Response (Server-Side): The server sends the HTTP response back to the client.

Client-Side: Receiving and Processing the Response:

Response Reception (Client-Side): The client-side application (browser) receives the HTTP response.
Processing the Response (Client-Side): The browser processes the response, updating the DOM (Document Object Model) if necessary and triggering any client-side events associated with the response.

Client-Side: Completing the Request Life Cycle:

Event Trigger (Client-Side): The request life cycle is considered complete when all necessary client-side processing has been done. This may include rendering updated content, handling user interface events, or triggering additional requests. -->
