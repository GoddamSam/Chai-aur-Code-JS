 <!-- What is an API?
 It stands out for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that defines how different software applications or systems would communicate with each other. It consists of the data that is communicated and the rules of arranging and organising the data in a standardized manner that is recognised across different systems. -->

<!-- Example 1-> It my frontend app is written in java and my backend server is written in python then how to exchange and communicate data between them.....so for this an api is required which defines what data is to be exchanged and in what format it is exchanged so that it is language independent. -->

<!-- Example 2-> If we want to build a weather app then we need to launch a satellite in space and collect weather data but we won't have the finances to do that for which we use api to request the data from third party softwares or systems. -->

<!-- Example 3-> In youtube, the video player might be written in java, the like button written in javascript and the comment section written in python so how do they work cohesively exchanging data and communicating with one another.....thorugh APIs. -->

<!-- Example 4-> When an app tells us to sign in with google it basically making us lazy since we don't need to additionally enter our info again instead the app is asking us whether we trust google or not and assuming we are already accounted on google and asking google whether we exist on google or not and if we do then send the data as well as with authentication token to register us on that app itself. -->

<!-- Example 5-> When we order food on Swiggy or Zomato then we are given a menu and we order just the food from it and the app fully takes the responsibility of delivering the food to us but we don't need to worry whether the chef who is specialized in that food is available or not or whether the restaurant is open or not or how the food will be transported....similarly we are given a documentation to make requests for whatever data we want and how to do that and voila!! without worryig about from where and how tha data will be fetched it is delivered to us in our program. -->
