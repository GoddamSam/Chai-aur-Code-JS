//for loop

//Example 
for(let index=0;index<5;index++)
{
    console.log(`The number is:-${index}`);
}

//When the control enters the loop, firstly the declaration and initialization of the lcv is done then the boolean condition is checked and if true the body is executed then just before the loop ends the updation of the lcv is done and the control proceeds to the next iteration

//break--> tranfers the control flow out of the loop skipping any statements after it

//continue--> transfers the control flow to the next iterative cycle skipping all statements after it for the current cycle
